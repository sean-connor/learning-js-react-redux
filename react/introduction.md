# Introduction to React


## Introduction
* The most important thing to understanding and using React successfully is thinking in the way of components.  Components should be, to me, the smallest re-usable visual piece within a view. Views should be made up of many components, many nested components.  Components can be re-used across various views.

* [Thinking in React](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
 * A good baseline on React's concept and how it utilizes a Virtual DOM

* [Presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/pedronauck/reactjs-keep-simple-everything-can-be-a-component)
  * Decent to flip through, goes over compoenentizing.




* [Tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)
  * Example of a React component for creating comments.


* [Displaying Data](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/displaying-data.html)
  * What we really care about, how do we get data onto the user view.


* [Transferring Properties](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/transferring-props.html)
  * Components have data either from their own 'state', those values retrieved on 'getInitialState' or they have data from their parent's state.
  * Generally we want Component state to be as high as possible and passed as properties. Picture a tree, if there are numerous branches and some leaves require the same data, we want to store it on their common ancestor.
