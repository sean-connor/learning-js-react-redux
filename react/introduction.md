# Introduction to React

* [Thinking in React](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html)
  * A good baseline on React's concept and how it utilizes a Virtual DOM
* [Tutorial](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tutorial.html)
  * Example of a React component for creating comments.
* [Displaying Data](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/displaying-data.html)
* [Transferring Properties](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/transferring-props.html)
  * Components have data either from their own 'state', those values retrieved on 'getInitialState' or they have data from their parent's state.
  * Generally we want Component state to be as high as possible and passed as properties. Picture a tree, if there are numerous branches and some leaves require the same data, we want to store it on their common ancestor.
